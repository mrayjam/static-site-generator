This is an example Markdown file to demonstrate the TypeScript Static Site Generator.

## Features Demonstration

### Code Highlighting

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com"
};
```

### Lists

- Markdown processing with frontmatter
- Syntax highlighting with PrismJS
- Multiple theme support
- Watch mode for development

### Links and Images

You can add [links](https://example.com) and format text with **bold** and *italic*.

This example shows how the generator processes Markdown files and converts them to HTML with proper styling and syntax highlighting.
